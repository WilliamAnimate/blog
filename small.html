// this is special, instead of || (or) we need to use &&. the reason might be obvious.
// what, you dont know why? ok you get redirected if width is less than 600 or height is less than 600. but then here, its >, meaning it will spam to index, which will spam back here
// to fix that, you need to check if both is renderable
// tl;dr instead of || you do && to make sure that both are renderable.

<h1>oops...</h1>
<h3>your screen size is too small (in width or in height?) to render the website correctly!</h3>
<p>sorry about that.</p>
<br>
<p>mistake? try clicking one of these</p>
<a onclick="r()">try again</a><br>
<a onclick="t()">force disable screencheck (appends #overrideScreenCheck)</a>
<p>to disable it either way, add the "#overrideScreenCheck" (without the "") to the page</p>
<h6>note: the webpage will usually display correctly because i don't know how to code. unless you're using an absurdly small screen it won't show up Willtendedâ„¢</h6>
